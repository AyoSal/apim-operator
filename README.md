# Apigee Apim Operator 

This sample demonstrates how to use the Apigee APIM (Api Management) Operator to perform API management tasks such as defining API products and operations using a GKE cluster.

The Apigee APIM Operator is designed to support cloud-native developers by providing a command-line interface that integrates with familiar Kubernetes tools like kubectl. The operator works by using various APIM resources to keep your Google Kubernetes Engine cluster synchronized with the Apigee runtime.

The Operator allows you to define and manage API management aspects directly within your Kubernetes cluster using the same YAML files and kubectl commands you already use for your other Kubernetes resources (like deployments, services, etc.). It brings Apigee's powerful API management capabilities right into your Kubernetes workflow.
